# Oscixer
Remote control of DAW

Oscixer is an Android app that allows remote control of a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The DAW targeted
during the initial development is the open source Ardour v5.4.0 available at https://ardour.org/  

Other DAW platforms may be included at a later date but my intent for the development is to provide a simple, intuitive,
remote for Ardour that will allow me, and others, to engineer recording sessions while performing the reports being 
recorded. For example, placing an Android smartphone or tablet on a music stand while performing the part being recorded
without needing to be able to see the computer screen or reach the computer keyboard.
