# Oscixer
**Remote control of DAW**

Oscixer is an Android app that allows remote control of a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The DAW targeted
during the initial development is the open source [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) v5.4.0.

Other DAW platforms may be included at a later date but my intent for the development is to provide a simple, intuitive,
remote for [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) that will allow me, and others, to engineer recording sessions while performing the reports being 
recorded. For example, placing an Android smartphone or tablet on a music stand while performing the part being recorded
without needing to be able to see the computer screen or reach the computer keyboard.

This project uses the [JavaOSC](https://github.com/hoijui/JavaOSC) library through [Maven Central](mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.illposed.osc/javaosc-core) .
